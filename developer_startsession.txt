Session workflow:
1. Starting a session creates a session identifier in the developer domain
2. This session can be referenced when loading context with loadcontext
3. Session activities are tracked for later recording
4. Sessions should be ended with endsession to record accomplishments
5. Session history becomes available for future startsession calls

You should:
1. Begin each focused development work period with startsession
2. Review the provided context to determine your focus
3. Choose a specific project, task, or milestone to work on
4. Use the generated session ID with the loadcontext tool to load specific entities
5. Work on your selected focus area
6. End the session with endsession when work is complete
7. Record accomplishments, task updates, and project status changes
8. Use the session history to maintain continuity between work periods
