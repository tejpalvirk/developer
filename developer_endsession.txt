A multi-stage tool for documenting development sessions, recording achievements, tracking task progress, and updating project status in the knowledge graph.

When to use this tool:
Only use this tool when the user explicity requests it or provides explicit approval.

Key features:
- Provides a structured, multi-stage workflow for session documentation
- Records session achievements in the knowledge graph
- Updates task statuses based on development progress
- Creates links between completed tasks and projects
- Updates project status and metadata
- Creates new tasks for future development
- Supports revision of previous stages when needed
- Offers a comprehensive assembly stage that consolidates all session information
- Organizes development activity into a coherent project history

The endsession tool uses a sequential, multi-stage approach with 6 typical stages:
1. Summary Stage: Records basic session information
2. Achievements Stage: Documents specific accomplishments
3. Task Updates Stage: Records status changes to existing tasks
4. New Tasks Stage: Defines new tasks created during the session
5. Project Status Stage: Updates the overall project status
6. Assembly Stage: Consolidates all information and finalizes the session record

Parameters explained:
- sessionId: Required - Unique identifier for the development session
  * Obtained from the startsession tool
  * Example: "dev_1234567890_abc123"
- stage: Required - Current stage of the endsession workflow
  * Accepts: "summary", "achievements", "taskUpdates", "newTasks", "projectStatus", or "assembly"
  * Each stage has specific data requirements and processing logic
- stageNumber: Required - The sequence number of the current stage
  * Starts at 1 and typically progresses through 6 stages
  * Used to track progress through the session documentation workflow
- totalStages: Required - Total number of stages planned for this workflow
  * Typically 6 for the complete workflow
  * Provides context for the progress within the overall process
- analysis: Optional - Text analysis or observations for the current stage
  * Descriptive text explaining the work done in this stage
  * Example: "Analyzed progress on the authentication system"
- stageData: Optional - Stage-specific structured data
  * summary: { summary: "Session summary text", duration: "2 hours", focus: "ProjectName" }
  * achievements: { achievements: ["Implemented feature X", "Fixed bug Y", "Refactored component Z"] }
  * taskUpdates: { taskUpdates: [{ name: "Task1", status: "completed" }, { name: "Task2", status: "in_progress" }] }
  * newTasks: { newTasks: [{ name: "NewTask1", description: "Implement feature A", priority: "high" }] }
  * projectStatus: { projectName: "ProjectName", projectStatus: "in_progress", projectObservation: "Making good progress" }
  * assembly: No stageData needed - automatically assembled from previous stages
- nextStageNeeded: Required - Whether additional stages are needed after this one
  * Boolean value (true/false)
  * Set to false on the final stage to complete the session
- isRevision: Optional - Whether this is revising a previous stage
  * Boolean value (true/false)
  * Default: false
- revisesStage: Optional - If revising, which stage number is being revised
  * Required when isRevision is true
  * Indicates which previous stage is being updated

When the endsession workflow completes (assembly stage with nextStageNeeded: false), the tool performs these updates:
1. Achievement Entities: Creates entities for each achievement and links them to the focus project
2. Task Status Updates: Updates the status of tasks mentioned in taskUpdates
3. Project Status Update: Updates the project status, adds an updated timestamp, and records observations
4. New Task Creation: Creates new task entities and links them to the project
5. Session Recording: Marks the session as completed in persistent storage

Return information:
- success: Boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded
- stageCompleted: The stage that was just completed
- nextStageNeeded: Whether more stages are required
- stageResult: The processed result of the current stage
- endSessionArgs: (Only in assembly stage) Consolidated arguments for the session
- sessionRecorded: (Final stage only) Whether the session was recorded
- summaryMessage: (Final stage only) Formatted summary of all recorded information
- error: (Only on failure) Error message describing the issue

You should:
- Complete all stages in order for comprehensive session documentation
- Provide specific details in each stage for accurate knowledge graph updates
- Be precise about task names to ensure they match existing tasks in the knowledge graph
- Use clear, descriptive names for any new tasks
- Include relevant observations for project status updates
- If making a revision, specify which stage is being revised
- Only mark nextStageNeeded as false on the final assembly stage
- Review the final summary message to confirm all session details were recorded properly
