A powerful tool for retrieving rich, contextual information about specific software development entities, providing formatted details based on entity type.

When to use this tool:
- Retrieving detailed information about a specific project, component, feature, or other development entity
- Exploring relationships between software development entities
- Examining project status, components, features, tasks, and issues
- Understanding the structure and elements of a software component
- Reviewing milestone progress and completion metrics
- Examining task details, dependencies, and assigned developers
- Exploring feature implementations and technical requirements
- Analyzing the project knowledge graph to understand entity relationships
- Preparing for work on a specific entity by establishing context
- Getting information about team members, technologies, and documentation

Key features:
- Provides contextually rich, formatted information about software development entities
- Adapts output format based on entity type (project, component, feature, task, etc.)
- Presents both direct entity information and related elements
- Organizes information in a clear, hierarchical structure
- Automatically identifies entity relationships and presents them systematically
- Tracks loaded entities within the current session for continuity
- Presents information in readable markdown format
- Supports contextual understanding of complex software architectures
- Shows relevant status information for project management

Parameters explained:
- entityName: Required - The name of the entity to retrieve context for
  * Example: "AuthService", "UserProfile", "LoginFeature"
- entityType: Optional - The type of entity being retrieved
  * Default: "project"
  * Accepted values: "project", "component", "task", "issue", "milestone", "decision", "feature", "technology", "documentation", "dependency", "developer"
  * Helps the system format the output appropriately
- sessionId: Optional - The current session identifier
  * Typically provided by startsession
  * Used for tracking entity views within the session

Each entity type returns specialized context information:
- Project: Shows status, components, active features, active tasks, active issues, upcoming milestones, team members, and recent decisions
- Component: Displays parent projects, implemented features, technologies used, active issues, documentation, team members, and dependencies
- Feature: Shows status, priority, description, requirements, implementing components, and related tasks
- Task: Displays project, status, priority, due date, description, assigned developers, related issues, and blocking items
- Milestone: Shows status, deadline, description, progress percentage, deadline status, and tasks grouped by completion status
- Other Entity Types: Shows observations and both incoming and outgoing relationships within the knowledge graph

You should:
- Specify the exact entity name for accurate retrieval
- Provide the entity type when possible for optimally formatted results
- Start with project entities to get a high-level overview
- Explore components to understand technical architecture
- Examine features to see functional requirements and implementations
- Review tasks to understand specific work items and their status
- Use milestone context to track progress toward deadlines
- After retrieving context, follow up on specific entities of interest
- Use in conjunction with startsession to maintain session tracking
- Remember that this tool only retrieves existing information; use buildcontext to add new entities
