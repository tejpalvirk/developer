A powerful tool for building and enriching the software development knowledge graph through creation operations.
This tool allows developers to add new entities, create relationships between entities, or add observations to existing entities.
Each operation type serves a specific purpose in constructing a comprehensive development context model.

When to use this tool:
- Creating new project components like features, tasks, and milestones
- Establishing relationships between development entities (e.g., component implements feature)
- Documenting observations about existing entities (statuses, descriptions, etc.)
- Building a graph of connected software development artifacts
- Recording new information discovered during development
- Tracking project structure, dependencies, and status
- Documenting developer roles and assignments
- Setting entity status and priority values
- Defining task sequencing and dependencies

Key features:
- Three distinct operation types (entities, relations, observations)
- Type validation against software development domain standards
- Automatic rejection of invalid entity or relation types
- Safe addition of new observations to existing entities
- JSON-formatted response with operation results
- Clear error messages when operations fail
- Handles both single and batch operations

Parameters explained:
- type: The operation type to perform, which must be one of:
  * "entities" - Create new software development entities
  * "relations" - Create relationships between existing entities
  * "observations" - Add observations to existing entities
- data: Operation-specific data structure:
  * For "entities": Array of objects with { name, entityType, observations[] }
  * For "relations": Array of objects with { from, to, relationType }
  * For "observations": Array of objects with { entityName, contents[] }

Entity Types:
- project - Overall software project
- component - Module, service, or package within a project
- feature - Specific functionality being developed
- issue - Bug or problem to be fixed
- task - Work item or activity needed for development
- developer - Team member working on the project
- technology - Language, framework, or tool used
- decision - Important technical or architectural decision
- milestone - Key project deadline or phase
- environment - Development, staging, production environments
- documentation - Project documentation
- requirement - Project requirement or specification
- status - Entity status (inactive, active, or complete)
- priority - Entity priority (low or high)

Relation Types include:
- depends_on - Dependency relationship
- implements - Component implements a feature
- blocked_by - Task is blocked by an issue
- uses - Component uses a technology
- part_of - Component is part of a project
- contains - Project contains a component
- has_status - Links entity to its status (inactive, active, complete)
- has_priority - Links entity to its priority (low, high)
- precedes - Task precedes another task (for sequencing)
- related_to - General relationship
- affects - Issue affects a component
- resolves - Task resolves an issue
- documented_in - Component is documented in documentation
- decided_in - Decision was made in a meeting
- required_by - Feature is required by a requirement
- depends_on_milestone - Task depends on reaching a milestone
- tested_in - Component is tested in an environment

You should:
1. Specify the operation type based on what you need to create (entities, relations, or observations)
2. Structure your data according to the operation type's requirements
3. Use valid entity types and relation types from the software development domain
4. Ensure entities exist before creating relations between them
5. Provide meaningful names and descriptions for new entities
6. Use observations to add metadata about entities
7. Create complete structures rather than adding entities/relations piecemeal
8. For task sequencing, use the 'precedes' relation to define which tasks must be completed before others
9. Set status values using the has_status relation (valid values: inactive, active, complete)
10. Set priority values using the has_priority relation (valid values: low, high)
